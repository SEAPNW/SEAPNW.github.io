                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The United States has often been dubbed the “melting pot” of different diasporas, peoples, and cultures from all reaches of the world. With each individual, new experiences and stories were brought to this diverse array of narratives. While some groups have longer and better-documented histories, others have not been observed or documented as extensively. This collection will focus on one such group: authors originating in Southeast Asia or being of Southeast Asian descent who then lived in or grew up in the Pacific Northwest. The hope for this collection to illustrate the unique experiences and intersection between traditional Southeast Asian cultures and the already diverse Pacific Northwest. Through first-hand accounts of their lives, authors or interviewers whose subject of writing falls into the acquisition interest area will help construct a largely unknown and undiscovered history of Southeast Asians in the Pacific Northwest including their treatment by the United States government and society upon arrival, how they coped with settling an ocean away from their homelands, and how they brought their traditions and cultures to the area.</h5>
                                        <h5 style="padding-right: 5px">
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this collection, acquisitions are not to be valued off of the “good” condition of the artifact or even the “rarity” or monetary value of the artifact, but instead by the authorship and relevance of the object. While a book like Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary may provide a broad, sweeping overview and account of Southeast Asian lives in the United States as a whole, the accounts are from various parts of the United States and only several, such as that of Dharmawan Lie’s son, are specific to the Pacific Northwest and those themselves are extremely brief. Nevertheless, this source would be crucial in the pursuit of the collection as it not only provides some specific examples of certain people of Southeast Asian descent in the Pacific Northwest, but it also can help contextualize the more general intersection of Southeast Asian cultures and American ideals. Due the content of the book being more important than the condition of the book, this collection does not hold edition, copy, or other physical attributes of the artifact as highly in importance as the authorship and subject of the text. Physical condition may be valued if the book has been circulated in the Pacific Northwest itself and some annotations, such as a child’s writing or drawings, or physical wear is shown. These conditions could give greater insight into who may have been reading the book and using the book, and would in itself provide a new story for the collection.</p>
                                        <h5 style="padding-right: 5px">
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For precisely the reason that many of the older “primary” textual resources do not exist, this collection must be divided into two sections: the first for “secondary” sources that consist of books, pictorial accounts, and even research papers that reflect the Southeast Asian experience in the Pacific Northwest, basically any materials that are about the Southeast Asian community in the Pacific Northwest created by someone or some organization outside of the community itself, and the second being composed of more recent restaurant menus, cultural event posters, advertisements, and even websites that emerged from these Southeast Asian communities. Each of these two “sub-collections” serve their own role in telling the story of Southeast Asians in the Pacific Northwest. The former helps to reach back in history to find early stories from these communities that would normally not be accessible in other forms. These resources also provide a glimpse into how Southeast Asian communities were perceived by authors and researchers outside of the communities themselves. The latter sub-category is useful in finding ephemera produced directly by the communities themselves. In turn, these items will display a more modern view of the Southeast Asian communities and exhibit how they wanted to be perceived by the society around them. Due to the nature of this collection, consisting of both physical and born-digital items, it is most effectively displayed as an online collection. The vast majority of the items in the collection are static- they are materials that do not change. Books and other graphic materials that have been printed or published online already cannot change, and thus are in their “final” forms, although small changes in the texts themselves could make these sources “dynamic.” Some of the other sources, however, can be completely considered dynamic. These sources specifically are websites and social media platforms of Southeast Asian restaurants and student groups in the Pacific Northwest. These internet-based items provoke many questions about their inclusion in a collection: how does one “collect” a website? How does the collection fare if a social media account or a website is deleted? To address the former, each webpage is displayed “live” in the web gallery of this collection so any updates that are made to the website are reflected directly in the collection. Additionally, as each item in the collection has an accompanying description, each web-item has a URL and date recorded. From these parameters and an online-website archive, the “Wayback Machine” (archive.org/web/), one can easily find exactly how the webpage existed at the given date. In regards to the latter, the deletion of an account or website would, perhaps unexpectedly, contribute to the value of a collection. The removal of such resources online would directly point to a shift in the community, the death of a cultural aspect of the community of the fading of certain traditions.</h5>
                                        <h5 style="padding-right: 5px">
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To collect within this collection, it is important to set constraints as to what countries are to be considered “Southeast Asian” and what areas in the United States are considered the “Pacific Northwest.” While there is no official definition of the region of “Southeast Asia,” both the Northern Illinois University’s Center for Southeast Asian Studies and Yale University’s Southeast Asian Studies program consider ten of the same countries to comprise Southeast Asia: “Burma/Myanmar, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam,” although NIU did also include Brunei in its list. The Pacific Northwest is perhaps an even more arbitrary term. While this geographic region is usually associated with the Washington State, Oregon, Idaho, and the Western coast of Canada, this collection is concerned with the experiences of Southeast Asians in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, so the Western coast of Canada will not be included in the scope of the search. While biographies and autobiographies are the most obvious pieces to fit this collection, other pieces of writing may also work well in this collection such as fictional books based on experiences of Southeast Asians in the Pacific Northwest. Due to the nature of the subject matter of this collection, any material that could be included in the collection would be relatively contemporary, typically created after the 20th century and for this reason no set time period was chosen for this collection. Additionally, the Southeast Asian community, due to factors both cultural and linguistic, was not very “outspoken” for the better part of their existence in the United States and thus did not produce many written materials. Instead, many of artifact contained in this collection are collection of photographs- many of which the originals are in private ownership or are owned by museums- compilations of personal anecdotes, sociological studies by governments and educational institutions, and advertisements for cultural events within these communities. </h5>
                                        <h5 style="padding-right: 5px">
                                            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Several existing catalogs and databases may help in assembling the collection. The most helpful of these would be institutions such as the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, that contain vast collections of publications about and by Southeast Asians from around the world, or museums like the Wing Luke Museum in Seattle focused on the Asian-American experience in Seattle. These resources each provide a specific focus on one of two aspects of the collection. From sources like these, completing the collection is a matter of finding the material that fits the focus of the collection. Although not much well-known literature specifically falling under the aim of this collection is circulated, the high concentration of the Asian population in the Pacific Northwest ensures that documentation and artifact exist that do exhibit Southeast Asians living in the Pacific Northwest. Additionally, the existence of departments such as the Southeast Asia Center at the University of Washington and the Southeast Asian collections at the University of Oregon, both organizations explicitly centered around Southeast Asian history and located in the Pacific Northwest, will immensely aid the discovery and collection of texts focused on Southeast Asian lives in the Pacific Northwest.</h5>
										<h5 style="padding-right: 5px">
											&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This collection can barely be considered a “book collection” in the traditional sense. Not every item is a book, many aren’t even physical artifact. This collection is not meant to be a traditional book collection; it is not meant to look solely to the past. This collection is a living beast; it will develop as the Southeast Asian community in the Pacific Northwest changes and ebbs and flows. The purpose of this collection is to attempt to piece together a story of the Southeast Asian community in the Pacific Northwest. This collection has to develop with time if it is to survive and continue to carry out its purpose. And as the “Melting Pot” of America continues to meld together various cultures and traditions, and the Southeast Asian community assimilates into American society one question remains: when will this living collection die?</h5>
